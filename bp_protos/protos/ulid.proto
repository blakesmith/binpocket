// A 'ulid' is another globally unique, random identifier, similar
// to UUIDs, but without many of the downsides:
//
// 1. They take up the same 128 bit storage space as UUIDs.
// 2. They have a leading millisecond precision timestamp prefix (so you can get the created time out of them).
// 3. They sort lexicographically, which is much nicer on our B-Tree databases.
//
// See the project / spec here for more details: https://github.com/ulid/spec
